```

Pass your logger to Kad:

// Import dependencies
var Node = require('kad').Node;
var JSONLogger = require('kad-logger-json');

// Create your logger
var logger = new JSONLogger();

// Plugin to your kad node
var node = new Node({
  /* ... */
  logger: logger
});
```

Pipe the log output to any writable stream:
